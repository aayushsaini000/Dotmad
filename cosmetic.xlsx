 Alexandrite Laser, what is it? And how it works?
 
 The Candela alexandrite GentleLASE 755 nm laser for hair removal allows you to perform quickly, comfortably and effectively.
 
 The Mini GentleLase Alexandrite is a laser with alexandrite crystal with a wavelength of 755 nm and its operation is used to emit an extremely intense and precise beam of light that crosses an epidermis and great tissue depths in which it is actively selected by melanin . In this sense, a melanin used as a vehicle to guide the laser beam to the deepest structures.
 
 Once in that place, check if a thermal reaction that causes the destruction of the hair, makes the hair bulb and the vascular structures that support or chirp performing as well as the selective phototherapy process. This process is guaranteed by the fact that the laser has an Alexandrite crystal that works with a wavelength of 755 nm, ideal for energy absorption by the melanin.
 
 The Mini GentleLase works with various levels of penetration, using different sizes of distances. This fact becomes particularly important in the optimization of the treatment, since it allows parameterizing it and understanding the skin color, color and hair density.
 
 This equipment has a dynamic cooling device to maximize patient safety and comfort. You can still work together with a refrigeration equipment (Zimmer) using the most comfortable treatment for the patient during his constant emission of cold air.

 Notes From the MFG:	Inside your cells, there is newer skin just waiting to get out.
 Focus treatments with the PicoSure laser activate your body’s natural skin cell processes 
 for healthy, more youthful-looking skin.
 Only Focus treatments lighten unwanted pigment AND uniquely stimulate the 
 production of new collagen and elastin—keys to
 younger-looking skin—without the pain or downtime of other laser treatments.

Buy with confidence from #1 rated medical seller online. As an accredited business we maintain an A+ Better Business Bureau Rating and we take pride in putting our customers first! 
 
We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! 
 
Payment Details: 
We accept checks and Bank Wires. 
We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  
 
Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. 
We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. 
We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. 
 
We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. 
 
To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: 
Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  
Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. 
 
Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

Buy with confidence from #1 rated medical seller online. As an accredited business we maintain an A+ Better Business Bureau Rating and we take pride in putting our customers first! 
 
We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! 
 
Payment Details: 
We accept checks and Bank Wires. 
We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  
 
Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. 
We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. 
We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. 
 
We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. 
 
To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: 
Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  
Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. 
 
Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

 MINIMAL DOWNTIME, IMPROVED PATIENT COMFORT, INCREASED SAFETY
 
  
 
 The eCO2 features the patented Controlled Chaos Technology (CCT), an algorithm to pseudo-randomly deliver each micro laser beam and by placing maximum distance between sequential beams the system eliminates cross thermal diffusion between adjacent Micro-ablative Columns (MACs).
 
  
 
 This allows the tissue to maximize heat dissipation between shots. The result is an increased safety profile with a reduction in post-operative discomfort and faster healing time leading to unparalleled fractional
 
  
 
 CCT reduces thermal damage by maximizing distance between laser micro-beams

The ultra-fast quick change tips come in a choice of three spot sizes, 120, 300 and 500 um, allowing you on-the-fly customized treatments. The eCO2stip auto-recognition feature automatically changes treatment settings to adjust for the change in spot size. Combined together, the advanced technology,quick-change tips and safety features ensure the ultimate control for the best outcomes.
 
  
 
 WHY eCO2
 
 Patients are attracted to low risk, minimal downtime treatments
 
 Controlled Chaos Technology creates pseudo-random micro wound patterns to minimize heat build-up, minimize downtime, increase safety and maximize patient comfort

						When it comes to maximal precision and high-end performance, UltraPulse CO₂ laser is the ultimate solution. For decades the UltraPulse® technology is considered as the gold standard when it comes to ultra-precise laser-tissue interaction. UltraPulse ST is an advanced computer controlled, user-friendly CO₂ pulsed laser platform. It is based on patented CO₂ laser tube providing up to 60 watts of power. It can generate a continuous series of short-period, high-peak-power pulses.
 
 During the high peak power, the laser energy is delivered very rapidly, resulting in vaporization of the targeted tissue without the creation of collateral injury. The Lasing modes (UltraPulse and Continuous Wave) can be alternated according to the desired tissue interaction while the three exposure modes (Repeat, Single & Constant) will allow comprehensive timed-controlled energy delivery.
 UltraPulse laser systems are for institutions and settings which demand highest performance for the most delicate surgeries.
 
 UltraPulse Unique Features
 
 -Fast and highly controlled treatment
 -Clean tissue interaction with virtually no char
 -SurgiTouch automated surgery with Digital AcuBlade
 -Largest suite of accessories to cover all listed clinical indications
 -Advanced scar management capabilities
 -Application driven user interface
 -Taking The Energy Delivery And Entire Operation To Its Highest Level Of Precision
 
 By pairing the Digital AcuBlade Micromanipulator with the SurgiTouch scanner. The laser energy is delivered inside a user defined geometric shape. The rapid motion of the scanner, faster than a human hand can produce, takes the controlled operation to another level of precision, resulting in:
 
 -Maximum control over incision length, ablation area and treatment depth
 -Minimal thermal spread and high preservation of surrounding tissue
 -Char free tissue interaction with clear margins
 -Replicated tissue interaction, customized to patient anatomy and the shape of the targeted tissue

br vocab="""" typeof=""Product""> This Quantel Medical Aramis II Remodeling Laser System is being sold for Parts and/or Repair. It is complete system that comes with handpiece, stand, fiber, goggles, tips, simplified user manual and 2 Cooling Cartridges. It powers up fine without any errors and reads ready to use but when the footswitch is pressed the screen displays the following ERROR: ""E:4000 A:84, PB relay defect, Power out of range (-40%)"" There is also no key included. (I was able to loosen the front panel and bypass the key switch for testing) There is a chance I could have some of the settings screwed up causing the codes? This looks like a really nice system and hopefully the next owner will be able to get it going again. Lot of nice parts here if nothing else. Will require freight shipping. Contact me with your delivery address for a freight quote.

 The VersaPulse PowerSuite 100W was Lumenis’ first high-watt holmium laser solution and a pioneer in its field. It has a successful clinical track record of over 15 years in treatment prostate enucleation (HoLEP) and stone lithotripsy.           
            
 The VersaPulse laser enables a wide range of settings from stone fragmentation to Stone- Dusting. Stone-Dusting Lithotripsy at high-frequency of above 50Hz is efficient at pulverizing stones. Clinical evidence suggests that stone dusting may reduce the need for basket extraction thereby decreasing possible complications associated with the routine use of ureteral access sheaths8. The low energy per pulse applied in dusting typically minimizes retropulsion.

						ELLEX Ultra Q LQP3106-U Ophthalmic YAG Laser System with Factory Table & Manual 
 
 
 Excellent refurbished mint condition; Very lightly used and just recently purchased by us from the doctor.  This model is almost impossible to find on the used market as we only get a few units per year.  
 
 This laser was removed from a very low-use environment and the condition both mechanically and cosmetically is pristine. 
 
 Our laser engineer has already inspected and serviced this laser thoroughly, guaranteeing its condition.
 
 All power output is well within factory specifications. The factory Ellex power table is included and this one is as close to new as you will find. 
 
 The Ultra Q includes the manufacture table, all accessories, elbow pads, dust cover and a full warranty!
 
 From the Manufacturer:
 
 The Ellex Ultra Q is the ophthalmic industry’s premier capsulotomy and iridotomy laser. With a firing rate of up to 3 hertz, it is the industry’s fastest photodisruptor. The Ultra Q also features a custom-designed laser cavity tested to deliver an exceptional lifespan, as well as a fine, two-point focusing system that provides a level of precision other photodisruptors simply cannot achieve. 
 
 The newest IOL materials are often more sensitive to laser energy, which poses new challenges when performing capsulotomy treatments. The Ultra Q incorporates Ellex’s most refined YAG laser technology, which produces an Ultra Gaussian treatment beam and enables consistent optical breakdown at ultra-low energy. This, in turn, results in less risk of lens pitting, more efficient tissue cutting with fewer shots, less cumulative energy delivered and faster procedures.

 We warranty our equipment for six months which includes parts and labor.
 
 
 
 One of the smallest YAG lasers on the market; very reliable and easy to use.
 The YC1800 is Nidek's current model and has some vast improvements from the previous models including a more robust laser cavity, faster firing rate, a more compact size, and much more.
 
  
 
 USER-FRIENDLY DESIGN
 
 The “Smart Switch” located on the joystick provides high operation functions, allowing doctors to change parameters (Energy up, Energy down, and Ready/Standby) while holding the joystick. Permits faster and easier operation and eliminates need to look away from oculars to make parameter adjustments.
 
 The YC1800 offers 0.3 to 10 mJ, continuously adjustable in increments of 0.1 mJ, allowing the precise tissue effect.
 
 The dual 635 nm aiming beam offers superior visual sensitivity, which in turn enhances the speed and ease of operation. The 635 nm beam is also safer to human eyes since it achieves the same crisp and sharp intensity of 650 nm or 670 nm beam with half the power output. The YC1800 has the ability to rotate the dual aiming beams 360º permitting work anywhere in the periphery without clipping the iris.
 
 The YC1800 can adjust the offset between ±500 microns (25-micron steps) to meet the varied clinical needs. A different offset can be used for PMMA, silicone or acrylic lenses, and the offset can even be adjusted on the same IOL to compensate for a parallax effect in the periphery. This eliminates the need to manually defocus, permits a clear field of view, and reduces lens pitting.

						The ZEISS VISULAS YAG III photodisruption laser brings together third-generation optical experience, technological excellence and a deep understanding of practical applications. It's superbly focused yet gentle cutting action has earned the device its reputation as the “sensitive scalpel” amongst secondary cataract lasers. Hitting the target within 4 nanoseconds makes the VISULAS YAG fast, simple, and successful
 for posterior capsulotomy or for iridotomy: the VISULAS YAG III gets straight to the point. It's smooth power makes it ideal for use in ophthalmic practices – even busy ones with high patient volume. The VISULAS III is more than a disruption laser. It offers an outstanding range of diagnostic possibilities and permits high-precision examinations to be carried out immediately before and after treatment – without the need to move the patient. The extensive selection of optional accessories and the mobile transport case perfectly complement the laser’s wide functional scope.
 
 Features:
 
 -Optimized energy:
 The high-precision Super-Gaussian beam profile of the VISULAS YAG III focuses the optimum amount of laser energy onto the point of treatment: only as much as necessary. This allows successful disruption – optical breakdown – to take place at just 2.5 mJ in air. In turn, this allows you to offer sensitive, high-precision treatment to your patients using a minimum of laser energy. The pulse repetition frequency of 2.5 Hz also facilitates a fast workflow and short treatment times.
 
 -Accurate focusing:
 The variable focus shift sets the focal point of the aiming beam precisely and reproducibly before, behind or directly at the focal point of the disruption laser. No more clumsy, manual de-focusing based on the position of the rear membrane. Thanks to this “safety distance”, damage to the tissue and intraocular lens during treatment is now also a thing of the past. This means greater comfort for you and your patients.
 
 -Fine adjustment of energy:
 Offering 22 levels of energy attenuation, the VISULAS YAG III provides ample flexibility for different treatment techniques. The fine gradations at the lower end of the output range permit optimum regulation of the laser energy for the sensitive, minimally invasive treatment of your patients.
 
 -Laser integrated slit lamp:
 The high-grade laser beam source of the VISULAS YAG III is fully integrated into the laser slit lamp. A top quality ZEISS product, the laser slit lamp was designed primarily for use in laser therapy, yet can also be used as a fully-equipped diagnostic slit lamp. Its lowered illumination prism, short corneal microscope and slim design make it ideal for daily clinical use.
 
 -Precision targeting:
 The unique 4-point aiming beam of the VISULAS YAG III ensures a high degree of aiming accuracy. Astigmatic distortions are clearly highlighted by the 4-point aiming beam and the selected energy level can be corrected accordingly before the laser beam is fired. The advantages are obvious: gentler treatment for your patients and extended life time for the laser source by avoiding “double firing”.
 
 -Perfectly coordinated processes:
 The flexibly positionable control panel is the intelligent nerve centre of the VISULAS YAG III. Its compact format offers handy and convenient control of the user-friendly interface. The laser energy is always clearly visible on the illuminated and reflection-free touchscreen. The selected laser parameters can be finely adjusted using the ergonomically designed rotary knob.
 
 This Zeiss VISULAS YAG III comes equipped with:
 
 -6 Month warranty
 -Power table
 -Dust cover

						Includes: 10mm Versastat, Footpedal, Integrated Cooling system, fiber pole 
 Notes from Mfg. The Lyra-i's Unique wavelength and flat beam profile maintain laser energy in the therapeutic range avoiding dangerous peak powers. Continuous parallel contact cooling combined with 1064 nm epidermal transparency protect the epidermis, permitting the safe treatment of all-skin types, and patients with recent sun exposure. the Lyra-i system combines the longest available wavelength with a unique flat beam profile to maximize patient safety and efficacy. The unique flat beam profile consistently delivers energy in the therapeutic range to all targeted structures. The Lyra-I uniquely avoids high peak powers ensuring patient safety. All Lyra-I patients are protected by patented continuous parallel contact cooling that protects the epidermis. These unique features provide optimal results through deep penetration to the hair bulb, deeper leg vein and to the papillary dermis for dermal remodeling while maximizing patient safety. The remarkable depth of penetration of 1064nm is due to its low scattering and epidermal transparency allowing the effective delivery of energy to deeply seated targets, such as blue and purple vessels while safely avoiding epidermal pigment. Computer adjusted fluence, delivered in adjustable pulse widths coupled with 1mm to 5mm continuously adjustable spot size is ideal for treating vessels from .5 mm to 4 mm. 
 
 Treats: Facial Wrinkles, Leg Veins (up to 4mm), Hair Removal (all skin types) and shaving bumps.

						2019 Q-SWITCH YAG laser is used for treatments of vascular/pigmented
 lesions, skin rejuvenation, tattoo removal, Hollywood carbon laser
 peeling, and other aesthetic treatments.
 
 Q-SWITCH YAG laser converts optical energy of the 1064nm laser
 wavelength into high energy pulses at 532nm, that are absorbed by
 a target pigment. The high peak power disintegrates the pigment
 into particles that are removed from the body through the lymphatic
 system.
 
 Q-SWITCH YAG laser emits short pulses to minimize discomfort to
 make procedures comfortable. The laser works with a variety of
 pigment colors since it has two different wavelengths: 532 nm and
 1064 nm. Having double laser wavelengths allows the operator to
 adjust the necessary intensity for each skin condition and type.

 Safety Features
 
 Several safety features on the Nidek YC-1600 YAG Laser are incorporated to protect both surgeon and patient. These include a filter to reduce the reflected Nd:YAG beam to 1/100,000 or less, an emission indicator to show when the laser is ready to be fired, a diagnostic function to monitor condition of the Nidek YC-1600 YAG Laser.

 Space requirements are minimized, and the combination adapter (optional) includes the split mirror illumination tower.
 
 Reliability and Safety
 Reliable Laser Output
 
 The YC-1800 employs the new technology to control the pulse number under the CPU “D-Pulse”, providing higher stability against environmental conditions and change over time.
 
 Fast Operation
 
 High-speed 3Hz firing rate offers very practical operation when encountering a moving eye or other patient difficulties. The YC-1800 can treat a wide variety of diseases, and its speed and efficiency allows comfortable operation.
 
 Great Number of Energy Settings
 
 The YC-1800 offers 0.3-10mJ, continuously adjustable in increments of 0.1mJ, allowing the most precise tissue effect.
 
 Super Adjustable Nd:YAG Offset
 
 yag-laser2The YC-1800 can adjust the offset ±500 microns (25 micron steps) to meet the varied clinical needs.
 
 A different offset can be used for PMMA, silicone or acrylic lenses, and the offset can even be adjusted on the same IOL to compensate for a parallax effect in the periphery. This eliminates the need to manually defocus, permits a clear field of view, and minimizes lens pitting.

 The LUTRONIC Encurve is the easy and comfortable way to reduce adipocytes through apoptosisinducing radiofrquency. Working through controlled delivery of energy deep into the
 adipocytes, enCurve utilizes a specialized frequency (27.12 MHz) combined with the ideal
 300 Watts of power to selectively target and heat adipocytes to the optimal temperature
 to cause denaturation of cells, leading to adipocyte’s death.
 
 NON CONTACT RF
 The appropriate applicator is placed over the area to be treated and the treatment is selected from the
 easy to operate GUI. The device measures the impedance of the tissue and begins to tune to the adipose
 tissue. It constantly adjusts energy in order to ensure and maintain homogeneous heating of the tissue.
 Patients relax while enCurve works to reveal their curves, while you gain the profits.

						Manufacturer : BTL
 
 Model : Exilis Elite Radio Frequency
 
  
 *Please do not hesitate to contact us regarding price, specification and condition detailed.
 
 
 BTL Exilis Elite is a non-invasive face and body contouring device designed to tighten skin while reducing fat and signs of fine lines and wrinkles.
 
 It uses a combination of monopolar radio frequency (RF) energy, ultrasound to stimulate fat lipolysis (the breakdown of fat cells) and collagen remodelling (for skin tightening), alongside skin cooking, helping to contour the body and face.
 
 The manufacturers state that no other device uses both ultrasound and radio frequency energy to provide similar results.
 
 The Exilis Elite uses a combination of radiofrequency energy (3.4Mhz up to 120 Watts), ultrasound and skin cooling to deliver controlled heating to target deep tissue, addressing deeper wrinkles, sagging skin and jowls, as well as the superficial skin layer, treating finer lines.
 
 The device comes with a handpiece to treat the body and a smaller one for treating the face. This is kept in almost constant motion as it treats.
 
 The tip of the applicator on the end of the handpiece uses focused thermal (heat) energy to disrupt the collagen fibres deep within the skin. The aim of treatment is to raise the temperature at the skin surface to 40-42°C for 4 or 5 minutes in each area treated to achieve the collagen tightening. This will be felt as a warming sensation by the patient.
 
 Collagen has a triple helix structure, which begins to unravel when affected by heat. Over time, the healing process encourages the production of new collagen fibres, smoothing the skin and reducing the appearance of deep wrinkles and fine lines. The new collagen fibroblasts help to tighten loose or slightly sagging skin, giving an overall more youthful appearance, and the collagen network is strengthened and stimulated, improving skin texture and laxity.

 This make the Lutronic Infini treatment is very safe yet powerful treatment for a variety of skin concerns including acne scar removal.
 
 The Lutronic Infini treatment takes less than 2 hours. A numbing cream is applied prior
 
 and we also offer various forms of medication for extra comfort.
 
 We require that patients arrange an escorted ride home after the procedure due to the use of medication.

 Manufacturer Notes:
 
 The Thermage CPT (Thermacool) system represents a new age of non-surgical skin tightening. 
 
 Using Comfort Pulse Technology and a vibrating handpiece, patients feel more comfort, and zero time off of work. The redesigned treatment tips deliver more uniformed heat distribution which leads to better tissue heating. More tissue is heated to optimal target temperatures and in turn more collagen is denatured.
 
 Superior results and greater patient comfort are at the core of the new system, which leverages our proprietary Comfort Pulse Technology™ and a vibrating handpiece for more comfortable treatments. 
 
 Key Features:
 
 - Improved efficacy — due to more uniform heating and increased volume of tissue reaching therapeutic temperature. 
 
 - Comfort Pulse Technology — including a vibrating handpiece, to deliver enhanced patient comfort
 
 - Ergonomically designed — A sleek handpiece improves ease-of-use and treatment efficiency
 
 - Seamless integration — the Thermage Body Tip 16.0 provides faster body treatments
 
 Face Area Tips
 
 Specially designed Thermage Face and Eye tips use precise, medium or shallow depth heating to smooth and tighten the skin of the face and neck (Face Tip), and the upper and lower eyelids (Eye Tip). Patients experience generally tighter skin and softened fine lines for an overall younger and refreshed look. Thermage Face procedures result in a smoother, tighter and younger looking face with minimal discomfort and without surgery, injections or downtime.
 
 Body Area Tips
 
 Specially designed Thermage Body tips use precise deep heating to contour and tighten skin, addressing sagging skin and unwanted bulges. Patients often see immediate tightening results that get better with time. Thermage Body procedures help smooth and tighten skin on the abdomen, arms, legs, and buttocks with minimal discomfort and without surgery, injections or downtime.

 NEWA – 3 Deep RF Skin Rejuvenation
 Conditon:  New in package
 Includes: Newa Skin Rejuvenation System (hand held), storage bag, A/C power cord, Lift Activator Gels. 
 
 Our Price:  $249.00    While supplies last, suggested retail $399.00
 
 •	NEWA Skin Care System - the most advanced skin tightening technology available for home use.
 •	Box, cloth bag & instructions included. Gel NOT included. You can use any gel you like.
 •	NEWA is the first at-home, FDA-approved radio frequency device available today. NEWA utilizes professional grade,   
         patented 3DEEP medical aesthetic technology, clinically proven to rebuild collagen, reduce wrinkles and tighten and lift
         the skin
 •	FDA cleared 3DEEP technology delivers focused and controlled energy deep into the dermis, stimulating the skin to
         naturally trigger collagen production, restoring the skin's natural support system, visibly reducing wrinkles for firmer, 
         radiant, younger looking skin.
 •	NEWA is the most clinically validated home-use device available, with scientific studies published in prestigious
         international medical journals that show proven immediate visible results that continue to improve for months after 
         treatments. NEWA treatments are very comfortable, completely safe and pain-free, and are as relaxing and enjoyable
         as a warm facial massage.
 
 •	The NEWA Effect:
 o	Immediately after the first treatment: Skin looks and feels tighter and plumper with a radiant glow that people 
         immediately notice. 
 o	After 4 weeks: Noticeable reduction in fine lines and wrinkles, and the skin is firmer and smoother.
 o	After 12 weeks: Further reduction in wrinkles with a noticeable lifting effect, providing tighter, smoother skin, with
          continuous long-lasting improvement over time.
 
 The NEWA Skin Rejuvenation system helps reduce the appearance of mild to moderate facial wrinkles and rejuvenates the skin using 3DEEP radio frequency technology. NEWA is the first FDA-cleared radio frequency device for home use in treating mild to moderate facial wrinkles. NEWA's innovative technology sends energy into the dermis, resulting in the appearance of smoother, younger-looking skin.
 
 NEWA is brought to you by EndyMed, the maker of professional radio frequency devices. EndyMed was able to create a smaller at home device with the same type of radio frequency technology for you to use in the comfort of your own home.
 
 How do I use it: Before using the device, remove all jewelry from the treatment areas, cleanse your face, and dry your skin. 
 
 Apply two thick lines of activator gel to the NEWA active tip, making sure the electrodes are completely covered. Place the NEWA to the first treatment area, and spread the gel on the skin.
 
 Turn side power switch to Level 2; the blue LED power button will turn on. Press and release it. Once the blue LED starts blinking, begin your treatment, moving the NEWA in a constant circular motion over the entire treatment area. The NEWA will vibrate at the end of the four-minute treatment. Apply more gel to the active tip and continue to the next treatment area.
 
 Once you complete your treatment, gently remove any excess gel from the skin and cleanse thoroughly. Remove any gel from the active tip. 
 
 From EndyMed.

 What are Clinicians Saying about Alma V-Shape:
 What is the V-Shape Ultra Laser by Alma?
 While SculpSure covers a larger area on your body (belly fat, arms, thighs, etc), V-Shape targets hyper-specific areas. Meaning: You can choose the exact spot that you want to destroy fat cells in! What’s more is that it is the most powerful tool for skin tightening and cellulite reduction. This treatment is the first of it’s kind on the market, with patented technology, and FDA approved. THE BEST PART: YOU DON’T FEEL ANY PAIN.
 
 How does the V-Shape work?
 The Alma Laser V-Shape Ultra delivers cold shear wave ultrasounds technology directly into whatever your problem area is (and you can get the treatment virtually anywhere!) It goes below your the surface of your skin. The energy from the ultrasound causes the fats cells to rupture, be destroyed, leave forever – whatever you wanna call it!! The radiofrequency technology supercharges the water molecules in your skin, that causes a heating reaction that makes your skin tighter, and more toned. The results are IMMEDIATE.
 
 Does V-Shape Ultra Hurt?
 We talked about my experience with SculpSure in a different post, and how it hurt a bit, but nothing I couldn’t handle. It was mostly just discomfort. But the V-Shape?? GIRL, THIS WAS LIKE FLOATING ON A CLOUD INTO A LIFE OF SMOOTHER SKIN. It was like a warm tingly feeling like my skin was falling in love. Love was definitely in the air. Me and my skin. My skin and the V-shape. Me and the V-shape. No pain, all gain, all love for this machine.
 
 How soon can I see results after my V-Shape treatment?
 V-Shape treatment result is immediate. Yep, I said it – IMMEDIATE. How insane is that? Not just that, but you should expect to see the better results as time goes on because most of the fat cells take a week or more to fully break down completely and leave your system. Some clients even notice more changes even 2-3 months later! For skin tightening treatments, results usually occur after the first session and every session after, too. Your max results will show about 3-6 months after your last session. That’s because the maximum amount of collagen and elastin will be made in your skin during that time (making your skin tighter, more toned, and younger looking).
 
 How many times do I need to get the V-Shape treatment?
 To be clear, the V-Shape Ultra machine does a couple of different miracle treatments. One being Selective fat destruction and reduction, and the second being skin tightening/cellulite reduction. You can combine these two for maximum and super noticeable results (recommended).
 For fat cell destruction 1-4 treatments are needed for best results and spaced 2 weeks apart.
 Laser cellulite reduction and skin tightening requires between 2 and 10 sessions, also spaced two weeks apart.
 IMPORTANT: You should always consult with a professional to understand your body’s needs. 
 
 So Umm.. Where Does All The Fat Go?
 In both SculpSure and V-Shape, your body starts to break down the fat cells naturally (the same way it would in your daily diet). The short answer: your liver breaks down and flushes out the cells after being carried through your body’s blood and lymphatic system. Then, your body expels the fat cells through your “bathroom time”.

						The Candela VBeam® laser system is considered by physicians world-wide as the ""Gold Standard"" for the treatment of a wide variety of vascular skin conditions.
 Candela VBeam® laser therapy is gentle enough for use on infants as young as a few weeks old, yet powerful enough to treat most adult skin problems. In addition to the best standard of care currently available in the industry, the VBeam is less painful than other vascular laser systems. This is due to Candela's exclusive technology known as a Dynamic Cooling Device (DCD). DCD sprays a liquid onto the skin before each laser pulse, cooling the upper layers of skin and providing increased comfort to patients. VBeam is the only pulsed dye laser with DCD integrated into the system.
 Candela Vbeam is a laser that sends short bursts of light to the skin and is absorbed by the skin or blood vessels being treated to improve the appearance and condition of your skin. Using advanced micro-pulse technology Vbeam applications range from correcting red and brown skin discoloration, to eliminating virtually all vascular and pigmented lesions. 
 Candela Vbeam is used to treat the following:
 Redness in the face or neck
 Rosacea
 Sun spots
 Age spots
 Angiomas
 Facial and leg veins
 Freckles
 Scars
 Stretchmarks
 Warts
 Psoriasis
 Poikiloderma
 Laser treatment with Candela Vbeam is a safe, noninvasive procedure. The procedure time varies based on the area being treated. You may see noticeable results immediately, and the number of treatments required for maximum results varies based on severity and the condition being treated. Little to no downtime is required post-treatment.

 Vibraderm Touch Screen (Digital) Model
 Microdermabrassion Cystal Free System
 Includes: handpiece, 5 small paddles, 10 medium paddles, owners manual and 90 Day warranty.
 Notes:
 Vibradermabrasion creates immediate results
 after just one treatment, but also starts to create
 new collagen in as few as three treatments.
 Vibradermabrasion is a new method of removing
 this dead tissue. In the past, machines have used
 small particles of Aluminum Oxide to ""Sandblast"" the
 skin. These machines treat a very small spot making
 it difficult to evenly treat a large area. They can also cause significant irritation. Vibraderm uses a large surface
 coated with fixed abrasives. Large areas can be treated
 evenly with less irritation. Studies have shown that
 Vibradermabrasion is more effective than
 microdermabrasion and patients prefer it.
 
 Also Note:  We are the manufacturer representative for this product and provide service and support for device. 
 
 We also manufacturer & provide the Consumable Paddles for this device.
 
 Warranty: 90 Days

 Multi-Derm Microderm System 
 Mfg. 2012
 Includes: Handpiece, 20 Medium paddles and owners manual. 
 Mfg. Notes: 
 The MultiDerm system uses a soft metal paddle that vibrates to gently exfoliate the skin. This is clinically proven to improve fine lines, wrinkles, age spots, sun damage, acne and acne scarring. In addition, the paddle can be used to infuse serums and moisturizers, which allows them to penetrate into the dermal layer of your skin. This treatment is often described as feeling like a massage on your face and neck. Unlike microdermabrasion, MultiDerm is safe to use on clients with rosacea or a history of broken capillaries.

						The PortaPeel 2000 is one of our most powerful, crystal and crystal-free microdermabrasion systems. It is second only to the UPeel.
  
 With the PortaPeel 2000, you sacrifice a small amount of power for portability. Weighing in at only 22lbs and equipped with a built-in handle, this system is perfect for moving around from treatment room to treatment room. Housecalls would even be manageable with the system!
  
 This system comes with a built-in O2 Hydramist sprayer. If you’re familiar with an oxygen facial, this is very similar. It’s an easy upsell of about $50 per treatment!
  
 The Porta Peel also comes equipped with both red and blue led. These are built into the wands and can be done at the same time as the microdermabrasion treatment.
 
 The system comes with 2 crystal chambers and a waste container built in. This means you can have each chamber filled with a different grit crystal or a different particulate altogether. Do you perform 2 passes on your clients? How nice would it be to do one pass with a coarser, 100 grit aluminum oxide and then one pass with a finer, 120 grit aluminum oxide?
  
 Here's what you'll get with the system:
 - PortaPeel 2000 crystal/diamond Microdermabrasion Console
 - Dual Red and Blue medical grade light therapy
 - Dual Crystal Chambers
 - Crystal and Diamond microdermabrasion
 - O2 Hydramist Sprayer
 - 3 Diamond tips (fine, medium and coarse)
 - 5lbs of aluminum oxide crystals. (grit: 80, 100, 120 or 150)

 Includes: 3 Stainless Steel Diamond Tips (Course/Medium/Fine), Titan Handpiece, manual and 30 day satisfaction guarantee.
 Notes:  Unlike Diamondtome / NewApeel we offer “replacement” handpiece tips for $ 150.00 each in lieu of having to buy a new tip like other vendors.  
 Mfg. Notes:
 The DIAMAsmooth™ Exfoliation System is a 100% crystal-free microdermabrasion system. Our stainless steel diamond tips are specially coated with a thin layer of real diamonds to allow for unparalleled, crystal-free treatments. Choose your tip, set your desired vacuum level and you are ready to perform a safe and effective abrasion on any skin type.
 
 The exfoliation process rejuvenates the skin by removing the upper layer of the epidermis and stimulating the production of new skin cells. The final result is firmer, more youthful looking skin over time. A series of treatments will dramatically improve the appearance of fine lines, acne, age/sun spots, and uneven skin tone.
 
 The DIAMAsmooth™ boasts important features such as compact & lightweight without sacrificing quality or performance. The system comes with everything that you need to start performing treatments and includes a 1-year manufacture warranty covering both parts & labor.

 Vendor Description:
 Dermalight 80 handheld UV-B Phototherapy Lamp is a drug free, clinically proven device for the treatment of all types of Psoriasis, Vitiligo, Eczema and similar skin conditions, both on the body and scalp. Dermalight 80 uses UV-B/311nm narrowband lamps that have a precise and unique spectral energy distribution with an emission peak at 311 nm that minimizes potential side effects like redness and itching. Also, a shorter period of exposure is needed. More effect, less discomfort.
 
 The Dermalight 80 can be used to treat all parts of the body, including the scalp with the special comb attachment which comes with the product. The comb attachment can also be used as a distance guard when treating other parts of the body. It is lightweight, portable and is powered by the AC adapter which comes with the product. Also included are UV goggles for eye protection and a LCD timer to ensure accurate treatment times.
 
 Treatment can be as little as 4 minutes 3-4 times a week for each area treated. To use it simply place it against the affected area. Positive results have been seen in as little as one week, however results do vary between individuals and severity of condition. We recommend that you consult your dermatologist for full treatment advice before use.
 
 Manufactured in Germany, the Dermalight 80 has already helped thousands of patients across the world to treat their psoriasis. Although designed for consumer at-home therapy, the device is also used by many professional dermatologists, clinics and hospitals across the globe. The device has passed the most stringent EU laboratory safety tests and is CE certified as a medical device. CE certification indicates conformity with the health and safety requirements set out in International Directives.

 The Sound Surgical Vaser uses a minimally invasive body contouring procedure that precisely and efficiently removes unwanted body fat. An alternative to the harsh techniques of traditional liposuction, VASER® Lipo uses state-of-the-art ultrasound technology designed to gently reshape your body.
 
 What distinguishes the VASER Lipo procedure is its ability to differentiate targeted fat from other important tissues – such as nerves, blood vessels and connective tissue. Innovative VASER technology breaks up fat while conserving these other important tissues.
 
 Only the VASER Lipo procedure uses the proprietary VASER System to first liquefy fat and then remove it from the body to promote smooth results and rapid healing with minimal pain and discomfort.

 It uses no heat or ultrasound energy, so the fat cells are just as healthy and viable as cells harvested using manual liposuction.
 It uses reciprocating motion to pass easily through tissue, especially fibrous areas, which makes procedures faster, and results in less bruising and bleeding.

We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! 
 
Payment Details: 
We accept checks and Bank Wires. 
We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  
 
Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. 
We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. 
We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. 
 
We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. 
 
To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: 
Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  
Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. 
 
Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

 Tickle Lipo is a procedure that targets and removes excess fat deposits using infrasonic technology. It regulates the compressed air supply to the Evamatic® handpiece which allows the Nutational Infrasonic Liposculpture®. Unlike conventional liposuction, Tickle Lipo is done under local anesthesia. During this procedure, a tube is inserted into small incisions that are made in areas with unwanted fat. The tube breaks up fat cells by emitting vibrations. These vibrations are what give Tickle Lipo its nickname.
 
 Advantages
 
 - Shorter operative time and shorter post-operative recovery
 - Less tiring and more precise work
 - Treatment of all the zones of the body
 - Reduction of the pain
 - Reduction of the complications occurring with other techniques (manual or assisted)
 
 Tickle Lipo uses infrasonic technology to assist in removing fat cells from many parts of the body. Some of the most common areas where it’s used include the:
 - inner and outer thighs
 - back
 - abdomen
 - buttocks

						Introducing the PowerX Lipo System, a new power-assisted liposuction device. The PowerX System utilizes a powered handpiece that causes the attached cannula to rotate based on predetermined angle and speed settings, allowing physicians to quickly debulk large areas of fat. The unique rotational motion generated by the system and multiple user settings enable optimal control during the procedure and reduce aspiration time and physician fatigue.
  
 The PowerX Difference
 The PowerX Lipo System has several key advantages over other liposuction devices on the market:
 Rotational motion of the cannula allows physicians to remove fatty tissue all the way around the cannula, rather than just above or below the orifice.
 Powered handpiece speeds up traditional liposuction cases and reduces physician fatigue.
 Minimal handpiece vibration compared to other power-assisted devices on the market.
 Vented handpiece provides continuous, uninterrupted suction and prevents tube clogging. In addition to speeding up the suction process, this can reduce trauma to the fat cells if the aspirate will be harvested for fat grafting procedures.
 Wide range of settings allows the physician to tailor the system to any body contouring application, from gentle, superficial work to more aggressive large volume fat removal.
 Can be used with an extensive list of cannula patterns depending on physician preference.
 The system works with all standard disposables.
 
 It is more cost efficient, less downtime, will maximize your bottom line. 
 The machine comes with 5 cannulas and 2 years of warranty

						Microaire PAL Liposuction System
 
 Microaire PAL Liposuction System (Power Assisted Liposuction)
 
 The PAL®-650 from MicroAire® is a powerful, precision instrument designed for small- or large-volume fat extraction, artistic body contouring, and harvesting fat rich in adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRC).
 
 PAL’s® smooth reciprocating cannulas glide through tissue, reducing the amount of physical effort required during liposuction and also reducing your O.R. time.
 
 Reciprocation also increases your control, helping you to gently guide the cannula with greater accuracy, even through dense fibrous tissue. The result is a faster procedure, less fatigue for you and more precise outcomes for your patients.
 
 Adipocytes and ADRCs harvested with PAL® are just as healthy and viable as cells harvested using manual liposuction; and PAL® produces higher yields of loosely adherent stem cells, which may improve graft retention. 2, 3, 4 Try PAL® and see for yourself how much better your body contouring and fat-grafting results can be. You’ll wonder how you ever got along without it.
  
 PAL® is the most widely used and preferred alternative to manual liposuction.
 
 -Proven Cell Viability
 -Less Bruising
 -Less Swelling
 -Less Surgeon Fatigue

 The MicroAire Power Assisted Lipoplasty Device uses a 2-mm reciprocating movement at 4000 cycles per minute to facilitate the movement of the cannula in tissue. So less force is required, especially in areas with more fibrous tissue. That makes the lipoplasty procedure easier on both patients and surgeons. It will ease your mind to learn that the PAL is not ultrasonic. No heat is generated by the instrument or cannula, so burning isn’t a concern.

						Sound Surgical Technologies LLC (SST), creators of the VASER Lipo System, focuses on ultrasonic technologies and related techniques for body sculpting and liposuction, utilizing a unique process called LipoSelection. SST's products reflect their emphasis on science and quality. SST provides advances in both technology and technique designed to promote precision and efficiency for the benefit of both patient and physician.
 
 Vaser is less invasive than other liposuction treatments – meaning a faster procedure, faster recovery time and faster visible results. 
  
 It replaces forceful physical effort with targeted technology, requiring only local anaesthetic and resulting in less pain afterwards. 
  
 Vaser liposuction uses ultrasound energy to break down fat cells, which are then easily removed by suction and massage. 
  
 The sound waves only affect fat, leaving other types of tissue (e.g. nerves, blood vessels) intact. This greatly reduces the risk of trauma and inconsistent results. 
  
 Vaser liposuction also stimulates collagen production and tightens the flesh, minimising the possibility of loose skin after the procedure.

						Valleylab Force 2 Electrosurgical Generator
 The Valleylab Force 2 Electrosurgical Generator provides cutting and coagulation in monopolar or bipolar outputs. Force 2 has audible and visual alarms, including REM™ Fault Indicator. The REM (Return Electrode Monitoring) is standard. 300 watts is available for output in the cut setting. A monopolar foot switch is included, a bipolar foot switch is optional as is a rolling cart.
 Valleylab Force 2 Electrosurgical Generator Features
 BLENDED CUT MODES – Provide flexibility through varying degrees of hemostasis. Choose one of three preset modes.
 SIMULTANEOUS INDEPENDENT COAGULATION – Permits two surgeons to fulgurate from a single generator, for added convenience and efficacy. Accessories are activated only when keyed, reducing the potential for injury caused by inadvertent activation.
 LOW VOLTAGE COAGULATION – Ensures controlled, precise desiccation with less destruction of peripheral tissue, making the Force 2 generator ideal for laparoscopic procedures.
 REM SAFETY – Is guaranteed with Valleylab’s patented adaptive REM system, which continually monitors patient impedance levels. If a fault in the patient/return electrode contact is detected, the REM system automatically deactivates the generator virtually eliminating the risk of burns under the return electrode. Valleylab REM safety has been proven in more than 100 million surgical procedures worldwide.

						Up for sale is a used VentX 2.0 Console (2015 Model), full setup with Vaser and PowerX. The machine is in great working condition and has been inspected and checked by our lab techs and guaranteed to work. The photos are the actual item. Included: VentX console, Vaser Liposuction with a handpiece, PowerX Liposuction with a handpiece, 4 cannulas
 
 VentX 2.0 Console Infiltration & Aspiration Unit
 
 A better way to remove fat
 The VentX 2.0 Console Infiltration & Aspiration Unit is the most precise infiltration and aspiration unit currently on the market. Together, VentX and VASERlipo form an all-inclusive platform for infusion, emulsification, and aspiration designed to optimize every step of the body sculpting procedure.
 
 With the VentX 2.0 Console, you can:
 - Easily adjust infiltration speed and direction. Slower infiltration rates provide greater comfort for wide-awake patients, while faster rates allow rapid dispersing of tumescent fluid
 - Accurately track infiltrate volume from 0 to 4,570 mL using the Precision Fluid Management System
 - Precisely set, display and control suction pressure. Physicians can reduce suction pressure with the fine-adjustment valve to preserve fat cell viability for subsequent grafting procedures. Provide continuous suction through the specially-designed vented cannula system
 - Reduce noise. The quiet system is ideal for in-office procedures
 - Easily connect with FDA-cleared fat harvesting accessories
 
 VASERLipo & VASERSmooth Handpiece
 
 Lightweight, ergonomic design facilitates precise contouring, with autoclavable hardware for easy, ongoing maintenance. The VentX Console is the most precise infiltration and aspiration unit on the market. Together, VentX and VASERlipo form an all-inclusive platform for infusion, emulsification, and aspiration designed to optimize every step of the body sculpting procedure.
 
 PowerX Lipo System: Precision Power-Assisted Body Sculpting
 
 The PowerX Lipo System utilizes a powered handpiece that causes the attached cannula to rotate based on predetermined angle and speed settings, allowing physicians to quickly debunk large areas of fat. The unique rotational motion generated by the system and multiple user settings enable optimal control during the procedure and reduce aspiration time and physician fatigue.
 - Rotational motion of the cannula allows physicians to remove fatty tissue all the way around the cannula, rather than just above or below the orifice.
 - Powered handpiece speeds up traditional liposuction cases and reduces physician fatigue.
 - Minimal handpiece vibration compared to other power-assisted devices on the market.
 - Vented handpiece provides continuous, uninterrupted suction and prevents tube clogging. In addition to speeding up the suction process, this can reduce trauma to the fat cells if the aspirate will be harvested for fat grafting procedures.
 - A wide range of settings allows the physician to tailor the system to anyone’s contouring application, from gentle, superficial work to more aggressive large volume fat removal.
 - Can be used with an extensive list of cannula patterns depending on physician preference.
 - The system works with all standard disposables.

 This advanced instrument allows the doctor to break up the vertically oriented fibrous bands that hold the clumpy, lumpy fat. Additionally, the tip of the ultrasound probe delivers ultrasound energy to liquefy the fat thus smoothing out the adjacent areas. Areas of excess bulging of fat can also be reduced through the use of  VASER micro-cannula lipo-sculpting. The doctor will then take that liquefied fat and use it to fill in indentations or large dimples in the treatment areas. The “cobblestone” or “orange peel” appearance of cellulite, which is causing skin dimpling and contour irregularities, is more efficiently and effectively treated than ever before by VASERsmooth.

Has been cleaned thoroughly. Only used 5-6 times in the life of the unit - over $113,000 new. Free freight continental US!
 
 The Liposonix treatment utilizes high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to permanently destroy subcutaneous adipose tissue in the anterior abdomen and flanks. The transducer, contained within the Replaceable Treatment Cartridge (RTC), focuses energy at specific depths, creating a rapid rise in local temperature at the targeted area. HIFU relies on the fact that, above a threshold of 56° C (for >1 second), irreversible cell death occurs. The Liposonix system offers precisely focused delivery of energy that does not harm surrounding skin, tissue, or organs.
 
 - Non-invasive single treatment results
 - Fast treatments in about an hour
 - Precise targeting of fat even within small and curved areas
 - Versatility in treating different areas of stubborn fat
 - Minimal discomfort
 - Little to no downtime

						OSYRIS Lipotherme Pharaon 980 Diode Laser 

This item is in Very Good condition but does not have a handpiece.

Lipotherme from Osyris Medical is a revolutionary next-generation laser-assisted lipolysis device. It delivers 25 watts of power at 980 nm in both continuous and pulsed formats for a variety of applications. It’s specifically designed cannula allows you to tailor treatments while ensuring perfectly homogeneous tissue heating with reduced tissue trauma. As a result, Lipotherme delivers the fastest and most efficient results of any laser-assisted lipolysis device currently on the market. 

What is it used to treat? 
The Pharaon Lipo® device can be used to remove small areas of stubborn fat, resistant to diet or exercise and works best on small areas of the face and body including: 
Chin 
Hips 
Knees 
Cheeks 
Buttocks 
Thighs (e.g. saddle bags) 
Upper arms (e.g. “bingo wings”) 
Male Breasts (or gynecomastia) 
Neck (areas of loose and flabby skin) 
Back (e.g. love handles and bra strap bulges) 

What is Laser-Assisted Lipolysis? 

Laser lipolysis 
is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that disrupts fat cells 
provides a skin tightening effect thru thermal stimulation 
is commonly performed under local tumescent anesthesia. 
The laser energy is transmitted through a fiber (which is threaded through a cannula) and delivered directly to the targeted tissues. This targeted approach is significantly less traumatic than conventional liposuction methods, offering minimal edema, bruising and bleeding…leading to faster healing and recovery times for the patient. 

Other features of the Lipotherme™ include 
Small incision results in greater patient comfort and treatment results 
600 micron fiber greatly reduces breakage resulting in fewer procedural interruptions 
980 nm semi-conductor (diode) for unmatched product reliability 
Perfect complement to liposuction 
Smart card technology for multiple procedure applications 
Upgradeable platform for additional applications

						High Powered Diode Laser System for Hair Removal
 
 Emvera Diolux is a high powered 810nm diode laser for permanent hair removal. Enhanced power provides less pain and effective results. Emvera Diolux also treats all skin types, because of the various pulse mode.
 
 Shortened Operating Time
 
 Emvera Diolux has the ability to operate at up to 10Hz, meaning a full back can be treated in as little as seven minutes.
 
 Increased Safety and Lower Costs
 
 Emvera Diolux utilizes a diode laser which is far more stable and uniform than other laser wavelengths used for hair removal (i.e. Alexandrite 755nm). This results in a system that costs much less to maintain and has safer and more effective results.
 
 Less Pain
 
 Emvera Diolux has a powerful chilled tip cooling system to minimize pain and reduce the risk of burning.
 
 Various Applications
 
 Emvera Diolux allows the operator to change their pulse mode from CW to short, long or combined pulses or even a MultiPulse mode which can protect darker skins. Coming soon will be a smaller spot sized handpiece for effective vascular and pigmentation treatments.
 
 Accuracy
 
 Emvera Diolux’s Specified Optical Device (SOD) uniformly radiates laser wavelengths so treatments are more effective. The SOD makes it possible to deliver concentrated high efficiency
 energy at the follicle, which decreases the loss and scattering of laser light.

 The Syneron Comet is a safe and effective system for hair removal and it can handle virtually any hair color or skin type.
 
 There are plenty of laser hair removal machines on the market, but few can match the Syneron Comet when it comes to hair color and skin type capability. This system can remove virtually all colors of hair, including white, blond, red, gray, brown and black, plus it can be used on any skin type or color. And with its effective skin cooling system your patients will barely feel a thing. Like most of the Syneron models, this features the exclusive elōs technology that combines radio frequency and a diode laser to deliver results that are superior to a laser or IPL alone. You can find newer laser hair removal systems compared to the Syneron Comet, but you will have a hard time matching the value and performance of this system. Contact Laser-Tech for the best quote on a quality certified pre-owned Syneron Comet diode laser machine.

 Buy with confidence from #1 rated medical seller online. As an accredited business we maintain an A+ Better Business Bureau Rating and we take pride in putting our customers first! We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! Payment Details: We accept checks and Bank Wires. We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. Thank You.

						State of the art cryotherapy with -30Â°C air

Newest generation cryotherapy system with cooled air for efficient pain treatment and swelling reduction, as well as relaxation of muscle tone.

						Isolaz Redefines Light-Based Acne Treatments
 
 The Isolaz system harnesses the dual power of Photopneumatic™ energy, by combining vacuum with the proven benefits of selected broadband light, to treat acne effectively. This combined technology followed by enhanced topical application, targets the root causes of acne for reliable results.
      •  CLEANSE: Pneumatics (vacuum) manipulates and stretches the skin, cleansing
          the pores and removing sebaceous material.
      •  PURIFY: Broadband light delivers heat and light to treat the lesion, reducing oil
          production, killing bacteria and purifying the pores.
      •  REPLENISH: Profusion, with the help of vacuum power, gives you the ability to
          apply topicals to the cleansed skin.
 
 The Isolaz Difference
 
      •  Efficient use of broadband light. Vacuum pulls the skin closer to the light source to
          safely and effectively deliver the energy to the target
      •  Mechanical pore cleansing. Vacuum helps to evacuate any sebaceous blockages
          and dislodge follicular ostia
      •  Topical infusion. Vacuum spreads skin cells to allow for, and assist with, the
          application of topical therapies into the intercellular spaces
      •  Fast, comfortable, non-systemic. The concentration of energy, IPL light and heat
          help prevent damage to the normal surrounding tissue
 
 Mechanism of Action
 
 Isolaz treatment includes Profusion, which enhances topical application, to improve overall treatment outcomes. See how Profusion works.

This type of efficient heating and vacuum stimulates the growth of new and better collagen and elastin which results in localized reduction in skin laxity, body volume, and an overall improvement in skin structure and texture.

Since it delivers predictable epidermal turnover with each treatment, nearly all patients see immediate improvement. And due to collagen remodeling, those results are enhanced over weeks and months.
 When it comes to acne scars, the Fraxel Laser treatment succeeds where other procedures have failed. The Fraxel  Laser with Zimmer Cryo System can reach deep into the dermis to stimulate collagen remodeling. While keeping surrounding tissue intact for maximum healing and minimal discomfort or downtime. Numerous clinical publications report that the Fraxel treatment provides more consistent, successful results than any other procedure now in use for treating acne scars.

 Syneron’s LV and LVA Applicator for Effective Treatment of Leg Veins
 Syneron’s LV and LVA applicators are designed to treat vascular lesions and leg veins. The LV applicator will treat vascular lesions that are up to 4-mm in size. The LVA applicator is perfect for smaller more resistant vessels and telangiectasias. The LV and LVA applicators work with the eMax and eLaser systems as well as the newer elōs Plus platform. All of these systems leverage Syneron’s proprietary elōs technology which delivers a combination of RF (radio frequency) and light energy.
 
 Expected Course of Treatment and Results
 Leg veins and telangiectasia can be resolved typically in 1 -3 treatment sessions. Some more difficult veins may require more than 3 treatments. Compared to other laser technologies, Syneron elōs utilizes less energy and provides for more accurate targeting of veins. Built-in contact cooling protects the epidermis from unwanted damage and helps to keep the patient comfortable during the procedure. During treatment, Bi-Polar RF energy is released between the two electrodes in the handpiece. RF energy is highly controllable which means the highest level of energy can be delivered to each targeted vessel. From a safety perspective, the risk of side effects is minimal.
 Treatment with the LV/LVA applicators will improve the appearance of unattractive leg veins, spider veins, facial spider veins, and more. Once treated, large blue/green leg veins and spider veins will fade over time. A patient can continue with treatment until they are satisfied with results. Treatments are usually spaced between 6-8 weeks in between and for spider veins 4 weeks apart.
 
 Candidates for Treatment
 Typical candidates for treatment are those who have adverse side effects to traditional Sclerotherapy, do not like needles or who simply prefer a more noninvasive treatment method.
 
 How is LV/LVA Applicator Treatment Tolerated by the Patient?
 The sensation may be described as a “hot pinch”. Patients tolerate treatment well by use of either cooling the skin during treatment and/or use of a topical anesthetic cream that numbs the skin.
 
 Possible Side Effects?
 It is rare for a side effect to result from treatment with the LV or LVA applicator, however, there can be the following: blistering, pigment changes and crusting. These are not permanent and will resolve in a very short period of time. Again, these occur rarely and the hand pieces have built-in contact cooling to ensure these unwanted side effects do not happen

We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! 
 
Payment Details: 
We accept checks and Bank Wires. 
We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  
 
Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. 
We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. 
We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. 
 
We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. 
 
To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: 
Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  
Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made.

Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. 
 
Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground.

Buy with confidence from #1 rated medical seller online. As an accredited business we maintain an A+ Better Business Bureau Rating and we take pride in putting our customers first! 
 
We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! 
 
Payment Details: 
We accept checks and Bank Wires. 
We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  
 
Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. 
We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. 
We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. 
 
We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. 
 
To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: 
Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  
Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. 
 
Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

 Manufacturer Notes
 ZERONA® is the first non-invasive body slimming procedure to effectively remove excess fat!
 
 Unlike other lipo and body slimming procedures, ZERONA® allows patients to continue daily activities without interruptions from surgery, pain, wounds, bruises, or garments. The ZERONA® protocol utilizes the Erchonia® Laser Scanner, which is the safest and most researched low level laser in the world. ZERONA® is also FDA approved for laser assisted liposuction. Find out how it works
 
 Voluminous adipose tissue can appear when fatty material is present, and this, in turn, can bring about enlarged subcutaneous fat regions. Because subcutaneous fat is close to the skin's surface, laser emulsification can have a dramatic effect on them. The collapse of adipose arrangements has been noted after laser therapy, reducing their volume and providing effective body slimming results. When the fat cells have reduced the body naturally excretes the fat over time giving the patient proven results after around six treatments over two weeks. This occurs during the body’s normal detoxification process.
 
 
 Let's take a closer look
 
 Four separate histological studies were performed to assess the efficacy of laser in the emulsification (liquefaction) of fat. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were utilized to analyze adipose tissue. SEM and TEM images revealed the collapse of adipose arrangements subsequent to laser therapy. The voluminous state of an adipocyte cell is reduced due to the emulsification process. The fatty material is evacuated from the cell and moves into extracellular space. The voluminous nature of adipocytes due to the accumulation of fatty material is what gives rise to an enlarged subcutaneous fat region. ZERONA® induces the formation of a transitory pore in the membrane of the fat cell. The pore enables the fatty material to seep out across the aperture and into extracellular space. The following images show the result of laser energy on a single fat cell and a group of fat cells.
 
 As you can see the ZERONA® treatment liquifies the fat and the cell dumps it into the intercellular space. There are two types of fat cells - Subcutaneous and Visceral.Subcutaneous fat is located directly above the skeletal muscle and below the skin. Its superficial placement is what ensures proper depth penetration of the laser energy. Patients containing a high volume of visceral fat (fat below the skeletal muscle) are not ideal candidates for this procedure. However, they may still contain subcutaneous fat; therefore, you can treat the individual by just ensuring they adopt a healthy diet to address the visceral fat.

 VentX Liposuction System
 The VentX Console is the most precise infiltration and aspiration unit on the market. Together, VentX and VASAERlipo  form an all-inclusive platform for infusion, emulsification, and aspiration designed to optimize every step of the body sculpting procedure.
 
 
 With the VentX console, you can:
 
 Easily adjust infiltration speed and direction. Slower infiltration rates provide greater comfort for wide-awake patients, while faster rates allow rapid dispersing of tumescent fluid.
 Accurately track infiltrate volume from 0 to 4,570 mL using the Precision Fluid Management™ System.
 Precisely set, display and control suction pressure. Physicians can reduce suction pressure with the fine-adjustment valve to preserve fat cell viability for subsequent grafting procedures. Provide continuous suction through the specially designed vented cannula system.
 Reduce noise. The quiet system is ideal for in-office procedures.
 Easily connect with FDA-cleared fat harvesting accessories.

						MOXI FLOW TM
 
 The operating principle behind the Moxi Flow Smart Flow Cytom-eter is a unique combination of Coulter-style cell size determination with simultaneous fluorescence detection. As cells flow single file through the microfabricated single-use flow cell the volume of each particle is measured at the exact same time as their primary fluorescence is measured using a 532nm solid state diode laser. Thousands of cells are measured in the 10 second read time and the data are plotted in a gradient density scatter plot as Cell size (volume) vs. Fluorescence (PMT voltage). Gating is easily performed on the unit using a interactive touch display, and the resulting live/dead ratios are automatically calculated (depending on the app selected). The analyzed data can also be displayed as a two color size histogram. Total volumetric cell counts are automatically determined for each test by precisely measuring the volume of fluid being analyzed.
 
 Applications: comes with pre-loaded applications that are optimized for each assay. This device is ideal for rapid characterization and quantification of cell suspensions in a clinical or research setting. Current applications are:
  Viability with PI
  Apoptosis (Annexin V-PE)
  2 Parameter Flow Cytometry - one CD marker marker
  Size Histogram
  Fluorescence Bead Assay

 Manufacturer's Notes: 
 Winner of the Editor's Choice Award for Best Hair Removal Laser (Aesthetic Trends and Technology). 
 
 The GentleYAG effectively treats all skin types, including tanned skin, offering unmatched treatment capabilities in permanent hair reduction, leg veins, facial veins, wrinkles and skin tightening. 
 
 Treat patients year-round with GentleYAG's 1064 nm wavelength, multiple spot sizes, variable pulse durations and Candela's patented cryogen cooling system (DCD) for maximum patient comfort and safety. 
 
 GentleYAG Advantages: 
 Fast 
 With unprecedented 18 mm spot size and repetition rates up to 2 Hz, the GentleYAG offers fast treatment with fewer laser pulses. In addition, the GentleYAG has the largest spot size of any Nd:YAG in the industry, and has the capability of delivering fluences up to 600 J/cm2 for vascular applications. 
 
 Powerful 
 26,333 watts of peak power and capable of delivering fluences up to 600 J/cm2 for vascular applications, and hair removal energies in pulse durations as short as 3ms for unparalleled treatment efficacies, especially finer hairs. 
 
 Treatment Versatility 
 The variable pulse duration, multiple spot sizes, and range of fluence allows the GentleYAG to: remove hair; reduce fine lines and wrinkles; erase leg and facial veins; and rejuvenate the skin. The GentleYAG is fast, powerful, and versatile. 
 
 Treats All Skin Types 
 Deep penetration with minimal scattering of laser energy makes the GentleYAG ideal for all skin types, especially dark and tanned skin. 
 
 Laser Procedures with No Downtime 
 The Candela GentleYAG is the only 1064 nm laser that uses the Dynamic Cooling Device to protect and cool the skin during the laser procedure. DCD maximizes patient comfort and epidermal protection by delivering a shot of cryogen to the skin prior to each laser pulse. DCD reduces the need for cooling gels and topical anesthesia, and permits for quick patient recovery. 
 
 Multiple Configurations 
 Choose the GentleYAG that is right for you. GentleYAG lasers come in multiple configurations to fit your specific needs. GentleYAG HR for unparalleled hair removal; GentleYAG SRT for skin rejuvenation and tightening through wrinkle reduction; or the GentleYAG VR for superior leg and facial veins removal. All models are upgradeable.

 4-in-1 Technology
 1: Vortex-Cleansing
 The HydroPeel tip hydrates the skin with nutrient-rich solutions, deeply cleanses the pores, softens and lifts away impurities.
 2: HydroPeel Exfoliation
 The patented HydroPeel tip has multiple abrasive edges that exfoliate the skin several times each pass to achieve better, even skin resurfacing results without irritation.
 3: Vortex-Extraction
 The vortex effect is created to easily dislodge & remove blackheads, whiteheads, and sebum, allowing for quick and painless extractions.
 4: Vortex-Fusion
 The unique spiral design of Vortex-Fusion uses hydrating skin solutions and potent antioxidants that improves the appearance of hyperpigmentation, oily skin, fine lines & wrinkles.
 
 
 What is the HydraFacial?
  The HydraFacial is a gentle way to bring new life to skin, restoring tired tissues and refreshing the appearance.  Now available at Allegro MedSpa, the innovative, new facial is perfect for anyone thinking about a deep exfoliation or peel, but not sure if an irritating technique will be right for their sensitive skin.  Through a patented Vortex Fusion delivery system, the HydraFacial will safely exfoliate the skin, debride away contaminates and dead skin, then infuse much needed moisture deep into tissues.  Patients will see an immediate vibrancy and softness to their appearance.  As the skin will continue to grow healthier and stronger, fine lines will disappear and dark, uneven areas will fade.  The benefits of a HydraFacial can last more than a week, and with regularly scheduled treatments, can result in beautiful, long term results.

						Selling used Eclipse Aesthetics Micropen Tatto Removal system.  Sold as-is No Warranty expressed or implied.  Free Shipping.
 
 Over 45 million people in the United States have tattoos. Of those, nearly 20% would like to have a tattoo removed. That means about 8 million people are looking for a safe, affordable and effective solution for unwanted tattoos. Eclipse MicroPen TR is the culmination of many years of research that has led to the perfect combination of technology and technique.
 Similar to the way a tattoo is applied, MicroPen TR utilizes very fine micro-needles to create precise wounds in the tattooed tissue while simultaneously introducing a proprietary solution to the treatment site.
 
 This proprietary solution is designed to coagulate the ink while causing minimal inflammation to the surrounding tissue. In about two to three week after the wound healing process begins, the ink is lifted out from the epidermis along with a small scab. New skin with natural pigment replaces the old skin and foreign ink.
 
 Our principal developers have refined the technology to deliver a precise amount of solution over an exact amount of time. By treating only a fraction of the skin in each session, the protocol ensures that the patient gets rid of the ink while minimizing the risk of side effects.

 Background Notes: 
 Coming from non-med spa general practitioner, the doctors Ultherapy machine is very lightly used / hardly used to date.
 The local regional Ulthera company trainer gal Pat was originally enlisted to conduct the treatment sessions at the doctors office but last year she elected to no longer do them
 Thus, the doctor has no current technician to do the treatments sessions for any booked or lined up client.

 The Aerolase LightPod Neo is the only 1064nm laser on the market that produces high-powered laser pulses (up to 318 Joules/cm2 on a 2mm spot) with a revolutionary 0.65 millisecond pulse duration, which is shorter than the Thermal Relaxation Time of the skin tissue surrounding the follicle, blood vessel or other targeted tissue structure. As a result, the laser-generated heat is effectively sealed within the target, as it does not have time to conduct outward to the surrounding skin, thus increasing treatment efficacy. Also, because the 0.65 msec laser pulses pass through the skin 5 to 50 times faster than those used by traditional long pulse Nd:YAG lasers they do not overheat the epidermal melanin thus eliminating pain and reducing risk of pigmentary changes. For treatment of larger volume varicose vessels, LightPod Neo also incorporates the 1.5 millisecond pulse duration.
