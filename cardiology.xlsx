Buy with confidence from #1 rated medical seller online. As an accredited business we maintain an A+ Better Business Bureau Rating and we take pride in putting our customers first! 
 
We offer dealer prices to the general public!!! 
 
Payment Details: 
We accept checks and Bank Wires. 
We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.  
 
Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. 
We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. 
For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. 
We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee. 
 
We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost. 
 
To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: 
Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required?  
Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days. 
 
Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price. 
 
Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding. 
 
Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc… for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/shortage” or “box crushed” etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. 
The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered. 
 
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork. 
 
Thank You.

 Pulsed Wave Doppler 
 Provides a sensitive and accurate quantitative assessment of blood flow, enabling the user to measure velocities and identify flow characteristics in arteries and veins. Doppler signals are exceptionally clean enhancing diagnostic confidence for vascular exams.
 
 Color Power Doppler 
 For quickly detecting blood flow in vessels, or for guiding the placement of a pulsed Doppler sample volume, color power Doppler is a very sensitive mode that is less angle-dependent than velocitybased color flow. Directional color power Doppler is also available on selected transducers.
 
 Tissue Harmonic Imaging 
 THI is an advanced technology never before available in this price range. In THI mode, the system processes echoes at the higher harmonic frequencies, resulting in images with reduced noise and clutter artifacts. This enhances image quality with finer dot size and improved tissue differentiation.
 
 PC Direct Connectivity 
 Offers a complete solution for digital documentation and image management on a standard PC. SiteLink image manager software downloads and automatically stores high-resolution images to an intuitive file system. Images can then be archived, reviewed and converted to other formats for use in QA programs and teaching, presentations, publications and for sharing with colleagues. DICOM and PACS interface solutions available.

 This device appears to be in good condition and operational. It passes it the self-tests and maves into programming mode smoothly.  There are no cracks or obvious faults externally.  The display and keypad are undamaged and the power supply is operational.  The condition of the battery was not checked, however it is sufficient to function without charging on power up.  I can find very little about the TAS on the net.  What I did see appears to indicate this system was developed in the late 1990s and was produced into the mid 2000s.  It appears Bayer may be producing the RapidPoint TAS based on this instrument.
 
 From what I can see: this analyzer is a lightweight, all solid state, microprocessor controlled system for monitoring coagulation and fibrinolysis. The analyzers keypad allows an operator to enter patient ID, operator ID, set Quality Control performance intervals, define Quality Control ranges and prohibit testing patient samples unless Quality Control as been successfully performed through the QC Lockout function. The TAS has an internal memory capable of storing up to 1000 patient results. Each test results includes patient ID, test type, sample type, date and time of test, lot number, analyzer serial number. An RS232 serial port allows for interface with a printer.

 ""Input Introducer Sheaths
 
 Medtronic offers a comprehensive range of access products for the diagnostic angiogram. Designed for easy insertion and for patient comfort, Input® Introducer Sheaths are offered in two brands – Input TS and Input PS.
 
 Input TS is Medtronic's FEP sheath with silicone coating to enhance the low drag coefficient of the sheath and dilator system. The polyethylene dilator with silicone coating and gradual taper reduces force during insertion.
 
 Input PS is based on the Input TS platform. The Input PS sheath includes a proprietary HydroPel coating that reduces insertion force. The Hydrophilic coating activates on contact with fluids to produce a smooth, slick surface. The Pebax material shaft adds the right balance of strength and flexibility for atraumatic insertion into tortuous anatomies.
 
 Product features of Input Introducer Sheaths include:
 
 Sit-Up Capability: Kink-resistant system provides 60 degree sit-up comfort for patients with an obturator in place.
 Locking Hub: Threaded dilator-to-hub interlock prevents dilator backout during insertion, and secure attachment of the sterile sleeve.
 Enhanced Tip Geometry: Advanced radiofrequency shaping technology creates a long, continuously smooth taper, for minimum resistance during insertions.
 Large Internal Geometry: Input TS's exceptionally large internal geometries facilitate hemodynamic monitoring and fluid administration.""

 HOW THE EXPORT AP ASPIRATION CATHETER WORKS
 Thrombosis occurs when clots form and obstruct the blood vessel. If this occurs in a patient’s arteries, it is called arterial thrombosis. In veins it’s referred to as venous thrombosis. When blood flow is interrupted, the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen. Prolonged oxygen deprivation can lead to death (necrosis) of the heart muscle (or myocardium). The primary reason to use an aspiration catheter is to remove the thrombus.

 The Philips iE33 is a premium level cardiovascular ultrasound machine that was launched in 2004 and has been revised and improved over the past decade. In 2010 Philips launched the iE33 xMatrix, a major update that supported the brand new xMatrix transducers with thousands of elements each and capable not only of extraordinary image quality, but also viewing images in 2 planes in real time as well as 4D without the need for a mechanical probe. The Philips iE33 xMatrix also has the powerful QLAB quantification package and a host of other cardiovascular specific software enhancements that speed and add diagnostic confidence to standard cardiac and vascular exams. The Epiq 7 has replaced the iE33, but as it has over a decade of being the cardiovascular gold standard it remains one of the most popular ultrasound machines in demand. Those looking for similar power and features at the premium level who focus on OB/GYN or radiology should consider instead the Philips iU22 which looks identical to the iE33 except for one touchscreen while the iE33 has two.

						CT TOSHIBA ACTIVION 16 2010
 Activion16 is a 16-slice Helical CT system that supports whole-body scanning.
 The system generates a minimum of 32 slices per 1.5 seconds using the Selectable Slice-thickness 
 Multirow Detector (SSMD).In addition, the high-speed rotation mechanism and the fast reconstruction unit of the system allow quick image acquisition to further improve throughput in
  CT examinations
 .FEATURES• Multi slice detector Detection elements with high-power and uniform out put characteristics enable a minimum slice thickness of 0.5mm, and accurate isotropic data can be acquired.
 The adoption of the SSMD method means that high-speed as well as high-resolution scanning are support-ed.
 The minimum slice thickness is reduced to 0.5 mm, making it possible to select the desired slice image for scanning from among 0.5 mm, 1 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm and 5 mm, depending on purpose.• High-speed scan Data for 16 slices can be acquired simultaneously in each scan. For example, scanning of the lung fields over a range of 30 cm at a slice thickness of 1 mm can be completed in 10 seconds or less Since the acquisition is completed in a short period off time, this obviously alleviates the burden on the patient, but also improves throughput by eliminating the need to wait for the X-ray tube to cool down.• High-quality images It is now possible to use thin-slice helical scanning for routine examinations. Based on high-resolution voxel data, smooth and finely-detailed 3D and MPR images can be obtained with the same size in the X, Y, and Z directions (isotropic). In CT cerebral angiography, for example, scanning over a range of 40 mm at a slice thickness of 0.5 mm can be completed in 4 seconds and image processing (such as 3D, MPR, or tomographic image processing) can be performed for a single volume acquisition dataset through simple operations. in addition, by stacking the data acquired using thin slices, images with reduced partial volume effects can be obtained

 Payment Details: We accept checks and Bank Wires. We also accept all major credit cards through Paypal.com and Visa or MasterCard direct through our own processor.

Shipping: We are now offering international shipping on freight orders, with very reasonable rates. We ship regular sized boxed orders with Fed Ex. For Paypal orders we can only ship to a confirmed address. If your Paypal address is not confirmed, please contact us for further details. We ship most orders via Fed Ex Ground. An exception can be made and United States Postal Service can be used for international shipments, but there will be an additional $30 charge for the additional time required for handling U.S. Postal Service orders. We also allow pickup by your freight carrier as long as prior arrangements are made. Also if use of pallet and/or packing is required there will be a $55 handling fee.

We always suggest using Van Lines delivery for very fragile and/or expensive goods. They are more expensive, but they are much more careful because they blanket wrap each piece and do not stack anything. Also their insurance has no deductible, and they offer inside and residential delivery at no extra cost.

To help us expedite the processing time for your order, please help us by sending the following information: Name/Company Name, who to mark attention to, City, State, Zip Code, Country, Phone number, (must be included for international shipments), and email address. And please state whether we are delivering to a business or residential address. On freight orders please tell us whether a lift gate truck will be required? Orders left at our facility more than 45 days after the listing closing will be considered abandoned, and will be forfeited unless prior arrangements have been made. Any payments whether partial or full will not be refunded on abandoned equipment. Please do not bid unless you plan on moving/shipping your equipment within 45 days.

Return Policy and Guarantee : THIS EQUIPMENT IS OFFERED WITH OUR AS-REPRESENTED GUARANTEE: For U.S. shipping addresses within the lower 48 states, this equipment is guaranteed to be as we represent it here in this listing description, or your purchase price will be refunded upon return in as-shipped condition for a full refund of bid price.

Please note: Shipping prices are normally quoted to business with loading docks. Residential or liftgate delivery will be an extra $35 per service required. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us for an exact shipping estimate prior to bidding.

Damage or shortage must be noted at the time of delivery on the delivery receipt. The consignee must check the outside of crates, packages, pallet etc; for dents, scrapes on boxes, cracks or anything on the outside of the packaging and note “damage/storage” or “box crushed”; etc on the delivery receipt. This will help to insure a good claim. The delivery receipt is for the purpose of recording the facts at the time of delivery and certifies that the freight was received in good order unless exceptions were noted. It is the consignee’s responsibility to check the freight and note on the delivery receipt any damages to the shipment. With no such exceptions noted apparently there was no question concerning the condition of the freight when it was delivered.
So, please thoroughly check the contents of your shipment before signing the delivery driver’s paperwork.

Thank You.

 MOBILE CATH LAB TRAILER SPECIFICATIONS AND FEATURES :
 I. CHASSIS:
 • Custom designed chassis consisting of two (2) 17"" deep, welded steel I-beams.
 • All structural members are welded and gusseted together.
 • Strongest and most durable medical trailer chassis on the market.
 • Include two (2) heavy-duty 20,000 lb. capacity axles.
 • Hub-O-Meter is installed on one of the axles to maintain a record of the trailer movement.
 • The axles are installed on an automatic air ride suspension system.
 • low profile air ride kingpin bolster plate to provide air-cushioning support for the sensitive
 electronics installed in the mobile unit.
 • Steel plates for the cardiac cath lab system and the electronics cabinets are welded in place,
 ensuring that critical components will be secure during transport.
 • Eight (8) premium quality radial tires for durability and extended service life.
 • Eight (8) aluminum rims: the outer four (4) rims are polished aluminum and the inner four (4)
 rims are machined aluminum.
 • Four (4) electro-hydraulic landing legs with security stabilizing pins are installed on the front and
 rear of the trailer, to both offload the trailer from the tractor and to assure positive fixed height
 of the unit at the operating site. Landing leg controls are conveniently housed in an underbody
 compartment, shielding them from weather and road grime for reduced repair cost and
 extended operational life.
 
 STRUCTURAL:
 • Specifically designed and constructed steel body for cardiac cath lab use, consisting of 2"" x 2""
 steel tube in the floor and 11/2"" x 11/2"" steel tube in the walls, welded into an incredibly strong
 framework, yielding a 93"" overall width, excluding slide-outs.
 • This conservative approach yields an exceptionally strong, rigid super structure for the
 installation of slide-out sections, door frames, patient lift and exterior body panels.
 • Two slide-out sections to increase the overall interior space in the procedure room. The slide outs are suspended from the ceiling and guided in and out with a synchronized gearing system With the touch of a button, the air-over-hydraulic cylinders deploy each slide-out and
 automatically lower the slide-out floor.
 • The exterior skin of the trailer consists of commercially available aluminum panels that are
 mechanically fastened in place.
 • The walls, floors, ceiling, and under body compartment are fully insulated with sprayed in,
 expanding polyurethane foam. This produces an effective vapor and insulation barrier for heat,
 cold, and exterior noise.
 • A vapor barrier, installed along the full length of the trailer floor, prevents moisture and odors
 from emanating into the trailer.""
 • The under body storage compartment is manufactured of welded steel. The open plan
 arrangement is insulated, heated and coated with a commercially available spray-on bed
 liner. The result is a highly durable coating that is easy to clean, reduces maintenance, increases
 sound attenuation, and provides an excellent appearance.
 
 PAD SITE HIGHLIGHTS:
 • Tractor weight of 17,000 pounds or less WITH Air ride suspension, 81"""" swing clearance
 between kingpin and cab, a 34,000 lb. rear bogie rating, and a 12,000 lb. front axle rating
 • Recommended Pad Size 12' x 52'
 • Pad thickness to be based on local soil conditions
 • Pad levelness should be not less than 1/4"""" per 10 feet.
 Overall length: 52'-4""
 IX. Trailer Basic Specifications:
 • Overall width: 8'-6"" Overall height: 13'-6""
 • Power requirements: 480 V, 30 fused at 150 amps
 • Personnel door width: 44"" O.D. 42"" I.D. Patient Lift Entry Width: 44"" O.D. 42"" I.D.
 • A 15-gallon water tank for the humidifier is located in the Plumbing: equipment room.
 The tank is fitted with a standard garden hose connection for convenience.
 • There are three phone and one data cable connections located in the under body, near
 the main power cable. These are standard marine type, Hubbell connections. There are
 three 50ft. Hubbell cords supplied with the trailer.

 All brand new EIMAC Tubes  that comes with a 1 Year warranty of 3000 Hours which ever comes first. We don't use china made tubes. All our customers require us to use only the EIMAC tubes.
 This unit like all our rebuilds go through extensive testing and repair from top to bottom. This includes all the upgrades.
 Fully tested and software calibrated Solid State Driver is critical to the best performance and longevity of the RF amplifier. 
 Once the amplifier is ready for test we calibrate these system with software that is specifically designed to meet or exceed manufactures specifications.
 After the pretest unit passes, we do a full 24 hour burn on the system.
 Final test is then completed and compared to the pretest to see if any changes have occurred during the burn-in process and we adjust accordingly. 
 
 We also rebuild all 3.0T, 1.5T and 1.0T RF amplifiers. Call or email us for a repair quote.
 
 We are the best in repairing all MKS series RF amplifiers with the best prices and best quality.

 The amplifier is linear and fully automatic. It is capable of delivering up to 25 kW (64 MHz) or 15KW (42 MHz) into a load VSWR of 1.5:1. Typical gain at 25 kW output will be 74 dB; typical gain at 15 kW output will be 71.8 dB.
 
 The amplifier consists of a four-stage solid-state preamplifier/driver followed by a two‑stage, grounded‑grid, vacuum-tube amplifier. The vacuum-tube stages provide approximately 25-dB gain. The balance is supplied by the solid-state preamplifier/driver.
 
 All major functions are controlled and monitored by a microprocessor (uP) based control system. The uP provides amplifier and MRI system protection from excessive average- and peak-power operation. The amplifier is remotely controlled via a serial interface during normal MRI system operation.
 
  
 
 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
 
 The models 53-S23A-64 and 53-S24A-42 are linear, pulsed, RF power amplifiers intended for use
 as part of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system.
 These models are Class 1, type B, ordinary equipment without applied parts. They are to be used
 in an area where no flammable anesthetics or gasses are used.
 Both models are UL Listed under UL 2601/ CSA 601 (file #E199620). Both have been
 investigated for compliance with the International Electrotechnical Commission Standard for
 Medical Electrical Equipment, IEC 601-1.
 The individual amplifiers do not comply with EMC requirements until the unit is installed in the
 MRI system. Verification of EMC compliance must be done after system installation.
 Each amplifier must be enclosed in an outer cabinet when operated in patient vicinity.
 SAFETY CONCERNS
 The amplifier must be installed, operated, and serviced by qualified personnel.
 The model 53-S23A-64 is capable of delivering in excess of 25,000 watts peak RF power at 64
 MHz into a 50-Ohm load. The model 53-S24A-42 is capable of delivering in excess of 15,000
 watts peak at 42 MHz. These power levels can cause severe RF burns and other injuries if
 misused. Never operate the amplifier without properly terminating it with a suitable load.
 The user accepts full responsibility for the proper use of the amplifier and for all safety issues
 concerning the use of RF power for medical purposes.
 SAFETY WARNINGS
 LETHAL VOLTAGES ARE PRESENT INSIDE THE AMPLIFIER. DO NOT OPERATE
 THE AMPLIFIER WITH THE COVERS REMOVED. CONSULT THE
 MANUFACTURER BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO SERVICE THE AMPLIFIER.
 DO NOT PLACE HEAVY OBJECTS OR LIQUIDS ON TOP OF THE AMPLIFIER.
 DO NOT BLOCK THE AMPLIFIER COOLING AIR INTAKE OR EXHAUST PORTS.
 
 UNITED RF, LLC IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
 INCORRECT INSTALLATION, APPLICATION, USE, OR FOR PATIENT SAFETY WHEN
 THIS AMPLIFIER IS USED IN A MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OR OTHER
 SYSTEM.

						We built the Trackmaster TMX425 to be the best stress treadmill in the industry. We did so by making it smoother, quieter and more reliable than any competitor, while centering the design on the absolute safety and comfort of the patient. The treadmill is self-calibrating, virtually maintenance-free and the safety features include a low profile deck, incredibly smooth belt operation and an easy-to-reach emergency stop switch. The large 22"" x 63"" deck absorbs impact while providing plenty of room to run or walk, and ergonomically designed handrails inspire patient confidence. Available manual and fully programmable rail-mounted controllers are simple and intuitive, allowing the treadmill to be used intependently from the stress system.

						The Quinton Q-Stress is the hospital industry´s gold standard. The PC-based cardiac stress system, winner of multiple awards (most recently Frost & Sullivan´s Market Engineering Award) is now in its ninth generation.
 
 Q-Stress is designed with you in mind. Its easy-to-learn left-to-right workflow and simple-to-understand icons and intuitive controls guide technicians through the stress test. Busy stress labs use QuikLists to enter comments quickly and efficiently.
 
 Our proprietary algorithm, baseline wander, and motion artifact filters reduce noise and produce clean ECG tracings even at high speeds and steep grades. Perfect for pharmacological stress tests as well. Patients will appreciate getting the best test results the first time.
 
 Features:
 
     Robust network connectivity – DICOM or HL7 connects with virtually everything needed for enhanced workflow. It´s compatible with your echo system, nuclear camera, EMR, HIS, PACs and other healthcare IT systems; e.g., GE MUSE.
     Full disclosure reports; allows you to save the whole exam and review it at any time by exporting to your electronic medical record (EMR) system or hospital information system (HIS).
     In-test review of stress testing data that includes ""rewind"" and ""freeze frame"" capabilities (both industry firsts) while still viewing the live test.
     Ectopic capture and display for heartbeats outside the sinoatrial node.
     Fully customizable panel display, plus the flexibility to add your own user-defined protocols.
     Risk scoring, procedural re-analysis, and extensive report formatting options.
     
 Benefits:
 
     Ease of use. The system’s Microsoft Windows compatibility (Vista or XP), left-to-right flow, and intuitive controls guide users through the procedure.
     Accuracy. Tracings are accurate and clear, with clean waveforms even at high speeds and steep grades.
     Instant replay. The Freeze Frame option allows you to ""rewind"" and view any section of any lead during the test.
     Full disclosure. With the full disclosure option, you can save the entire cardiac stress test as a PDF and store it to your electronic records repository.
     Easy analysis. Built-in analysis tools allow modifications for new patient data or for physiologic changes – resting cardiac data remains constant for comparison.
     Customizable. You decide how you want your patient´s cardiac test data presented. Create custom reports based on physician´s preference. Easy reporting. QuikLists enable fast, efficient preparation of your reports.
